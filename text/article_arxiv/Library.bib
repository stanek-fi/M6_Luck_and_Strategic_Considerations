  abstract = {Good macroeconomic and financial theorists, like all good theorists, want to get the facts straight before theorizing; hence, the explosive growth in the methodology and application of time-series econometrics in the last twenty-five years. Many factors fueled that growth, ranging from important developments in related fields (see Box and Jenkins, 1970) to dissatisfaction with the ``incredible identifying restrictions'' associated with traditional macroeconometric models (Sims, 1980) and the associated recognition that many tasks of interest, such as forecasting, simply do not require a structural model (see Granger and Newbold, 1979). A short list of active subfields includes vector autoregressions, index and dynamic factor models, causality, integration and persistence, cointegration, seasonality, unobserved-components models, state-space representations and the Kalman filter, regime-switching models, nonlinear dynamics, and optimal nonlinear filtering. Any such list must also include models of volatility dynamics. Models of autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (ARCH), in particular, provide parsimonious approximations to volatility dynamics and have found wide use in macroeconomics and finance1. The family of ARCH models is the subject of this chapter.},

The method is useful for models such as high-dimensional multinomial probit (MNP), where computation has restricted applications.},

The new formulas show that the expected squared Sharpe ratio is a function of the length of the available data, the number of assets and the maximum attainable Sharpe ratio. My results enable the portfolio manager to assess the value of efficient portfolios as investment vehicles, given the investment environment.},

A key objective of the M6 competition was to contribute to the debate surrounding the Efficient Market Hypothesis (EMH) by examining how and why market participants make investment decisions. To address these objectives, the M6 competition investigated forecasting accuracy and investment performance on a universe of 100 publicly traded assets. The competition employed live evaluation on real data across multiple periods, a cross-sectional setting where participants predicted asset performance relative to that of other assets, and a direct evaluation of the utility of forecasts. In this way, we were able to measure the benefits of accurate forecasting and assess the importance of forecasting when making investment decisions. Our findings highlight the challenges that participants faced when attempting to accurately forecast the relative performance of assets, the great difficulty associated with trying to consistently outperform the market, the limited connection between submitted forecasts and investment decisions, the value added by information exchange and the "wisdom of crowds", and the value of utilizing risk models when attempting to connect prediction and investing decisions.},

However, incentive-fee funds take on more risk than non-incentive-fee funds, and they increase risk after a period of poor performance.

The economy studied in this paper consists of traditional ("Markowitz") investors as well as status-seekers who are concerned about relative wealth. The model highlights the strategic and interdependent nature of portfolio selection in such a setting: Low-status investors look for portfolio choices that maximize their chances of moving up the ladder while high-status investors look to maintain the status quo and hedge against these choices of the low-status investors. In equilibrium, asset returns obey a novel two-factor model in which one factor is the traditional market factor and the other is a particular "high volatility factor" that does not appear to have been identified so far in the theoretical or empirical literature. This two-factor model found significant support when tested with stock market data. Of particular interest is that the model and the empirical results attribute the low returns on idiosyncratic volatility stocks to their covariance with the portfolio of highly volatile stocks held by investors with relatively low status.},

In particular, we suggest to construct a studentized time series bootstrap confidence interval for the difference of the Sharpe ratios and to declare the two ratios different if zero is not contained in the obtained interval. This approach has the advantage that one can simply resample from the observed data as opposed to some null-restricted data. A simulation study demonstrates the improved finite sample performance compared to existing methods. In addition, two applications to real data are provided.},

Whereas the pair-wise Sharpe ratio test show that the performance of all the 18 iShares are indistinguishable, our test results reject the equality of the Sharpe ratios in each year as well as in the entire sample; implying that the 18 iShares perform differently in each year as well as in the entire sample, with some outperforming others in the market.
